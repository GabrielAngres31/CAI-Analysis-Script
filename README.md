# CAI-Analysis-Script
The location where files relating to the CAI script and analysis are kept.

The "v3" folder contains all files and the initial dataset required to run the program. 

There are four subfolders:

**parameters**
**data_files**
**image_output**
**table_output**

**parameters** contains any list or dataframe that you need to refer to in the program to iterate over to generate various plots.
Lists of models to go into individual heatmaps get their own folder in this section.

**data_files** contains all .csv files that you can refer to in your program.
full_data is an aggregation of `PARL0_06202022.csv`, `Pad_Area_Estimations.csv`, and `dry_weight_proportion_raws`, joined and augmented with some additional measures as necessary for the analysis.

THE CODE THAT GENERATES THESE PARAMETERS, AND A FULL DESCRIPTION OF THE PARAMETERS, WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE NEXT UPDATE

**image_output** holds all of the figure plots generated by this program, organized by folder networks.
**table_output** holds all of the .csv tables generated as output by this program.

The main program file is **data_filtration_augmentation**. This file contains all of the functions needed for this program.
You can run these functions individually from the console as long as all the parameters you pass are valid.

NOTE: Except for the qqPlot function, none of the image-creating functions create any graphical devices OR turn them off.
Please make sure that you use `UTILITY.quickPNG()` and `dev.off()` for these functions.




### Quick installation using conda (Linux64)

Download the latest EDTA:

`git clone https://github.com/GabrielAngres31/CAI-Analysis-Script.git`  
`cd CAI-Analysis-Script`

Find the yml file in the folder and run:

`conda env create -f CAI.yml`


The default `conda env` name is `CAI` specified by the first line of the `CAI.yml` file. You may change that to different names. Once the conda environment is set up, you can use it to drive other versions of CAI. 

First, it is strongly recommended to ceate a dedicated environment for CAI:

```
conda create -n CAI
conda activate CAI
```


## Usage:
```
conda activate CAI
cd Script_v3
Rscript data_filtration_augmentation.R
```


IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE THE FOLLOWING LIBRARIES ARE INSTALLED BEFORE RUNNING THIS PROGRAM:
```

car
Rcmdr
hash
multcompView
HyperG
plotly
htmlwidgets
magrittr
tidyr
